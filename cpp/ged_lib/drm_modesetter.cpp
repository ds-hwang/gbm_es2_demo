   * However, this isn't as easy as it sounds. First, we need to check whether
   * the connector is actually used (a monitor is plugged in and turned on).
   * Then we need to find a CRTC that can control this connector. CRTCs are
   * described later on. After that we create a framebuffer object. If we have
   * all this, we can mmap() the framebuffer and draw a test-picture into it.
   * Then we can tell the DRM device to show the framebuffer on the given CRTC
   * with the selected connector.
   *
   * As we want to draw moving pictures on the framebuffer, we actually have to
   * remember all these settings. Therefore, we create one "struct modeset_dev"
   * object for each connector+crtc+framebuffer pair that we successfully
   * initialized and push it into the global device-list.

   * active encoder+crtc on a connector to avoid a full modeset.
