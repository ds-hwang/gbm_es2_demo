# GBM ES2 Demo
* Example OpenGL ES2 demo using GBM and DRM(KMS) modesetting
* This shows how ChromeOS renders GLES2 contents on the screen.
* It's the best way for embedded device to use OpenGL ES2/3.

# Build
```

> ./configure
> make
```

# Run
* I successfully run it on Ubuntu as well as ChromeOS.

## Ubuntu
* Go to tty1 with Ctrl + Alt + F1
* Kill gdm or lightdm because they are DRM master now. This demo has to be DRM master.

```
